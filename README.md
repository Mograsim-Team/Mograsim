# Mograsim [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Mograsim-Team/Mograsim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Mograsim-Team/Mograsim)

Mograsim is a modular, graphical simulator for teaching microprogramming, ISAs and 
circuit logic in a way that allows for a smooth transition between those levels. 

The aim is to give students a better understanding how these layers blend in a machine, 
and what the purpose of microprogramming is. In more detail, Mograsim allows:

* Programming and running simple assembler on the machine *(in development)*
* Defining an ISA (Instruction Set) to use in the assembler *(in development)*
* Microprogram the CPU to implement the specified ISA
* View the Circuit Logic operating and executing the microprogram in detail

Mograsim focuses especially on the AMD Am2900 Family microprocessors in a specific 
16-bit arrangement used by the Technical University of Munich as an example.

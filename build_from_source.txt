This is a very basic instruction for building Mograsim from source. It assumes you know nothing about Eclipse Plug-In development, Maven, or Git.

0. Prerequisites
	0.1 Eclipse 2019-06
	0.2 (optional) Git

1. Install PDE
	1.1 In Eclipse, click on "Help" -> "Install New Software..."
	1.2 Next to "Work With:", select "The Eclipse Project Updates"
	1.3 Tick "Eclipse PDE Plug-in Developer Resources" (expand "Eclipse Plugin Development Tools" or type "PDE" in the search bar to see it)
	1.4 Click on "Next >" two times, read and accept the license, and click on "Finish"
	1.5 Wait for the installation to complete (may take a while). When prompted, restart Eclipse.

2. Clone the Git repository and import the projects
	Can be done via Git or via EGit (Eclipse Git).
	2.a via EGit
		2.a.1 In Eclipse, click on "Window" -> "Show View" -> "Other..."
		2.a.2 Select "Git Repositories" (expand "Git" to see it)
		2.a.3 In the "Git Repositories" view, click on "Clone a Git repository"
		2.a.4 Enter the repository URL ("Host", "Repository path", and "Protocol" should fill automatically); click on "Next >"
		2.a.5 Select only "development"; click on "Next >"
		2.a.6 Enter the directory you want the Mograsim projects to be saved in
		2.a.7 Tick "Clone submodules" and "Import all existing Eclipse projects after clone finishes"; click on "Finish"
	2.b via Git (needs Git to be installed)
		2.b.1 In a command prompt (Terminal on Linux; git-bash on Windows), execute "git clone --recurse-submodules --single-branch -b development <repository URL> <target directory>"
		2.b.2 (optional) Import the repository in Eclipse:
			2.b.2.1 In Eclipse, open the "Git Repositories" view as described in 2.a.1 - 2.a.2
			2.b.2.2 In the "Git Repositories" view, click on "Add an existing local Git repository"
			2.b.2.3 Enter the directory of the repository and tick the repository you see in the list below; click on "Add". (If there is another repository ending with "SWTHelper", ignore it)
		2.b.3 Import the projects into the workspace
			2.b.2.1 Click on "File" -> "Import..."
			2.b.2.2 Select "Existing Projects into Workspace" (expand "General" to see it); click on "Next >"
			2.b.2.3 Tick "Select root directory:" and "Search for nested projects"
			2.b.2.4 Next to "Select root directory:", enter the directory of the repository; click on "Finish"

Note: After importing the projects, probably an automatic workspace build will start. Wait for it to finish before continuing.

3. Do the Maven Tycho workaround:
	In the project explorer or package explorer, right-click on "net.mograsim.tycho-download", click on "Run As" -> "Maven clean" and wait for it to finish

4. Build the Update Site
	4.1 In the project explorer or package explorer, right-click on "net.mograsim", click on "Run As" -> "Maven build..."
	4.2 Next to "Goals", enter "clean verify"; click on "Run" and wait for it to finish (this will take a while)
	4.3 Select all projects, right-click, and click on "Refresh"

The update site now should be built and is located in net.mograsim.plugin.updatesite/target/repository.
In there you should see, among other files, a folder named "features", a folder named "plugins" containing some jar files, and two jar files called "artifacts.jar" and "content.jar".
